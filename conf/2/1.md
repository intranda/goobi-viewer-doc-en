| **sleep**                                      | Waiting time of the Goobi viewer Indexer (in milliseconds) between monitoring cycles of the hotfolder. The default value is `3000`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The default value is <code>2048</code>. </p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **solrUrl**                                    | URL of the Apache Solr HTTP server that contains the index. All communication between the Goobi viewer indexer and Solr takes place via HTTP queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **oldSolrUrl**                                 | <p>f certain fields are to be transferred from an old Solr index to the new one during a complete new indexing, this element must contain the URL to the old Solr. The transferred fields are <code>DATEECREATED</code>, <code>DATEUPDATED</code> and <code>THUMBNAILREPRESENT</code>. For anchor records the <code>IDDOC</code> is added. If the records are in a <code>DATAREPOSITORY</code>, the information about the affiliation is also ported.</p><p>This switch was introduced with version 4.8.0 to allow the migration from Solr 4 to Solr 8. In a regular installation this element is not needed.</p>                                    |
| **viewerUrl**                                  | URL to the Goobi viewer to automatically remove old images from the cache when reindexing a record, for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **viewerAuthorizationToken**                   | A token is required so that the Goobi viewer can be informed of any changes when records are moved between DataRepositories. The token is stored in `config_viewer.xml`. See also [chapter 1.33.3](../1/33/3.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **deleteContentFilesOnFailure**                | It can happen that the indexing of an object fails due to an incorrect XML file, for example. In such a case, the file and all associated folders (media, full texts, Word coordinates, etc.) are removed from the hotfolder. Depending on the object, however, it can happen that the associated folders contain large amounts of data, so that copying this data into the hotfolder takes a lot of time. In such cases it is possible to leave these folders in the hotfolder even if they fail, so that they can be used with a corrected XML file. Remaining these folders in the hotfolder has no effect on the indexing of any other objects.  |
| **addVolumeCollectionsToAnchor**               | When indexing multi-volume records, volumes may belong to different collections. If this element is set to true, collection names from all volumes contained in the index are also copied to the complete record (collections to which only the complete record belongs are also retained). It should be noted here that any typographical errors in collection names can no longer be automatically removed from the complete record if this option is activated. The default value is `false`.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **representativeImage/useFirstPageAsDefault**  | If `true`, the first page of a document is set as the representative image if no other page is specified in the source document. If this is set to `false`, and no page is explicitly set as representative, no representative image will be set. The default value is `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **namespaces**                                 | <p>If additional XML namespaces are embedded in METS documents, these must be communicated to the Goobi view Indexer so that corresponding XPath expressions can be evaluated. The namespace name is defined as the element name within the element, the namespace URI as the text value of this element. <br>If no additional namespaces are defined, there must be no empty <code>&#x3C;list></code> element.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **pageCountStart**                             | The Goobi viewer is expecting a page count starting with 1. Versions before that, on the other hand, start counting at 0. In order to counteract a constant deviation in page navigation, compatibility with older Goobi viewer versions can be established by setting the value to 0. The default value is `1`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **addLabelToChildren**                         | If this switch is set to true, the values of the `LABEL` fields of structure elements are written to the `DEFAULT` field of subordinate structure elements. The default value is `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **labelCleanup**                               | If this switch is set to true, non-sort character sequences "`<ns></ns>`", "`<<>>`" and "`¬`" are removed from the value. The default value is `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **authorityData/@enabled**                     | If the value is set to `false`, indexing of authority data is completely disabled. The default value is `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **authorityData/addFieldsToDefault/field**     | Values, certain standard data fields (for example, alternative spellings of a name) can be added to the DEFAULT search field to ensure direct searchability. A new configuration element is added for each desired field (for example, `<field>NORM_ALTNAME</field>`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **aggregateRecords**                           | If set to `true`, the additional fields required for the aggregated search (such as aggregated full texts and metadata) are written to the index. The default value is `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **fulltextForceUTF8**                          | If set to `true`, full texts are automatically converted to UTF-8 if another charset is detected. Default value is `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **mets/preferredImageFileGroup**               | If file groups are configured here and a group with this name exists, it is used for indexing image file paths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **lido/imageXPath**                            | To consider the heterogeneity of image paths in LIDO documents, the possible XPath expressions (relative to lido:resourceSet) in which image links are searched are configurable. The list is processed from top to bottom, and the first expression that returns hits is used (the rest are ignored).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **email/...**                                  | If errors occur during indexing, the Goobi viewer Indexer can notify the email addresses defined in the recipients element. Configuration is carried out in the same way as described in [chapter 1.5.2](../1/5/2.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **viewerNotifications/prerenderPdfs/@enabled** | If active, the Goobi viewer will be instructed to pre-generate PDF files when indexing a record that has images in the hotfolder. Default value is `false`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **viewerNotifications/prerenderPdfs/@force**   | If active, the Goobi viewer is instructed to pre-generate PDF files even if there are no images in the hotfolder. This can be used for example during reindexing for the one-time generation of the files. Default value is `false`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **viewerNotifications/prerenderPdfs/@variant** | Specifies the pdfConfig variant from the contentserver configuration file to be used for generating the PDF files. Default value is `small`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
