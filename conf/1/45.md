# 1.45 Developer

A separate page is available for developers in the backend under the URL `/admin/developer/`. A ZIP file with configuration settings for commissioning in a local development environment can be downloaded there. It is also possible to pull the theme checked out as a Git repository on the server with a click. Two scripts are available to support this. Calling the scripts is configured in this section:

```xml
<developer>
    <scripts>
        <pullTheme>{config-folder-path}/script_theme-pull.sh {theme-path}/../../../../</pullTheme>
        <createDeveloperPackage>{config-folder-path}/script_create_package.sh -d viewer -f {base-path} -s {solr-url} </createDeveloperPackage>
    </scripts>
</developer>
```
