# 1.11.2 Navigation between structure types

Via `<docstructNavigation />`, structure types can be defined between which it is possible to navigate quickly in full screen mode (such as "next chapter or next figure"). For this, the attribute `enabled="true"` must be set. The default is `false` . Several structure types can then be defined in `<docstruct>` elements. The navigation then automatically jumps forward/back to the next found element whose type is configured in this list via corresponding buttons. As with metadata configurations, different templates can be configured depending on the type of the main document.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<viewer>
    <docstructNavigation enabled="false">
        <template name="_DEFAULT">
            <docstruct>document</docstruct>
            <docstruct>illustration</docstruct>
        </template>
    </docstructNavigation>
</viewer>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
