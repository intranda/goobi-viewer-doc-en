# 1.46 External Ressources

The Goobi viewer can retrieve external content from Born Digital documents and process it live. This makes it possible to export only the metadata for Born Digital documents to the Goobi viewer and to download, prepare and present the actual content as required and to automatically delete it from the server again after a defined time interval.

The configuration to recognise which data records are affected, what the download URLs look like and when the artefacts should be deleted again is done in the following section:

```xml
<externalResource>
    <urls>
        <template>http://d-nb.info/{MD_FILEURL}/34</template>
    </urls>
    <deleteAfter>
        <value>5</value>
        <unit>minutes</unit>
    </deleteAfter>
</externalResource>
```
