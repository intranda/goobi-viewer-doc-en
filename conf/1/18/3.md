# 1.18.3 Sorting of collections

By default, your collections are sorted alphabetically by their names in the collection overview (that is, not by the names in `messages_*.properties`). However, it is possible to define your own sequence.&#x20;

The following configuration determines how the collections are sorted:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<collections>
    <collection field="DC">
        <sorting>
            <collection>collection2</collection>
            <collection>collection1</collection>
        </sorting>
    </collection>
</collections>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Collections (raw names) that are listed here are listed first and in the specified order. All other collections are listed behind it in the standard sort (see above).&#x20;

It is possible to sort certain parts of the collections. For this you can group the `<collection>` tags in a `<sortingList>`:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<collections>
    <collection field="DC">
        <sorting>
            <collection>collection2</collection>
            <collection>collection1</collection>
            <sortingList sortAfter="collection2">
                <collection>collection3</collection>
                <collection>collection4</collection>
            </sortingList>
        </sorting>
    </collection>
</collections>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The attribute `sortAfter` specifies the name of the collection behind which the collections listed in the `sortingList` are to be sorted.&#x20;

If the collection specified in `sortAfter` has subcollections, but the first collection listed in the `sortingList` is on the same or a higher hierarchy level as the `sortAfter` collection, the collections of the sortingList are also sorted after all subcollections of the `sortAfter` collection.

If collections listed in `<collections>` have subcollections that are not contained in the sort list, they are sorted alphabetically within the listed collection.

It is also possible to specify the sorting for collections and/or sub-collections:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config_viewer.xml" %}
```xml
<collections>
    <collection field="DC">
        <sorting>
            <sortOrder collections="colregex.*">alphabetical_raw_desc</sortOrder>
            <sortOrder collections="newspaper.foo.*">alphanumerical_asc</sortOrder>
        </sorting>
    </collection>
</collections>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The `<sortOrder />` element is repeatable. A regular expression to which the sorting is to be applied must be defined in the `collections` attribute. The following sorting schemes are available for sorting. All schemes can have the suffix `_asc` or`_desc`. `_desc` reverses the order, while `_asc` is identical to the scheme without the suffix.

* `numerical` - Numerical sorting according to numerical values. If the collection names are not numbers, they are simply sorted alphabetically
* `alphabetical` - Alphabetical sorting according to the translated collection names. If there are no translations for the collection names, this is identical to `alphabetical_raw`
* `alphabetical_raw` - Alphabetical sorting according to the collection name as it appears in Solr
* `alphanumerical` - Alphanumerical sorting, which always sorts alphabetically, but numbers contained in the name are sorted numerically. Sorts like `alphabetical` according to the translated collection names
