# 1.13 Opening certain document types in alternative page views

It is possible to open certain document types in alternative page views. If, for example, newspapers and newspaper volumes should always be opened in the calendar view (instead of the image view), this can be configured as follows:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="config_viewer.xml" %}
```markup
<viewer>
    <recordTargetPageTypes>
        <Newspaper>calendar</Newspaper>
        <NewspaperVolume>calendar</NewspaperVolume>
        <MultiVolumeWork>toc</MultiVolumeWork>
        <Periodical>toc</Periodical>
        <item>fulltext</item>
    </recordTargetPageTypes>
</viewer>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

In this case, the usual logic for finding the appropriate page view when opening the record is ignored and the configured view is used.&#x20;

Optionally, the default view for all structure types can be defined under `_DEFAULT`. This is used if no explicit configuration exists for the structure type in question.&#x20;

The following views are possible:

* image
* object
* toc
* thumbs
* preview
* metadata
* fulltext
* fullscreen
* calendar

{% hint style="info" %}
If TEI full texts are available in different languages for a data record and `fulltext` has been selected as the default view, the full text is opened in the current browser language.
{% endhint %}
